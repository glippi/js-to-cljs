# Transform JavaScript code into ClojureScript

This project aims to offer the same translation feature available in [Calva](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva), which let you translate snippets of JavaScript into ClojureScript, but in a [web page.](https://glippi.github.io/js-to-cljs/public/index.html)

The main library, responsible for the transformation is the very same code of Calva itself, you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/blob/published/src/cljs-lib/src/js_cljs/core.cljs).

So this project is relying 100% on the code of Calva, I just extracted and glued together some things in order to use it as a web app.

Thanks to the people behind Calva for making such a great open source tool to work with Clojure!
